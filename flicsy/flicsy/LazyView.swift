/// Creates a lazy view from view.
///
/// Helpfull for use of `NavigationLink` within `list`, where destination views    are loaded immediately even when the user hasnâ€™t navigated to that view.
/// Embedding the destination view in LazyView makes the destination view lazy and speeds up performance significantly for long lists.
///
/// ```Swift
/// NavigationLink(destination: LazyView(Text("Detail Screen"))){
///    Text("Tap me to see detail screen!")
/// }
/// ```
